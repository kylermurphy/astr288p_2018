## Exercise 2-1

If you were following along in the notes you should have created 2 files in your *~/ASTR288P/Lecture2/* directory,  *Data1.txt* and *Data2.txt*. Using the **mv** command; move these files to a new directory *~/ASTR288P/Practice/* and rename *Data2.txt -> Data3.txt*.

An excellent resource for the **mv** command can be found here, https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-mv-command/.

## Excercise 2-2

Write a bash script that when run in the current directory will generate two files, *AlphaList.log* and *RevAlphaList.log*. The file *AlphaList.log* should contain the path of the current dirctory on the first line followed by a list of the files in the current directory in alphabetical order. The file *RevAlphaList.log* should contain the path of the current directory followed by a list of files in the directory in reverse alphabetical order. Both log files should also contain the permissions for each file in the directory. **NOTE**, you can name the script what ever you want but in general the names of scripts should (at least vaguely) reflect their utility. Test the script on your home directory.

The page https://www.howtoforge.com/linux-ls-command/ contains examples for the **ls** command.
