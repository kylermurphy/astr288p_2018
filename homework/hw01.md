## Instructions
Please place the answers to these questions in:

~/ASTR288P/homework/

A shell script will be used to collect homework assignments from these directories. If your homework is not in this directory it will not be collected and will be considered incomplete.

Questions 1 and 2 can be answered as comments in the the script you need to write for Question 3.

## Questions

1. What is a shell script? **(1)**

2. How does the command line know which language (bash, tcsh, pyton, etc.) to use to execute a script? Hint, this is referred to as the *shebang*.  **(1)**

3. Using variables, write a **bash** shell script that prints the following to the screen **(8 total points)**: 
    * *Your* username **(1)**
    * The username of the person running the script **(1)**
    * The current date and time **(1)**
    * The name of the computer on which the script is being run **(1)**
    * How long the comuter that is running the script has been running (hint: There is a simple Linux command for this) **(1)**
    * **Note** The interpreter (command line) must know that this is a bash script (see question 2).

Please provide your code as a \<your\_username\>_hw01.sh file for which you have given all users read and execute permission **(1)**. 

Provide an example of the output of the code as seen when run on your machine in a text file \<username\>_hw01.log **(1)**.

Include the terminal command used to pipe (hint!) the output to screen and to the log file; provide this as a comment at the **end** of the log file. **(1)**

You may need to look up the names of some of the required variables as they are not guarunteed to be in the course notes (there are too many to list!).	

**BONUS** Create a tarball containing all the required files and place it in ~/ASTR288P/\<your\_username\>_hw01.tar **(1)**.
