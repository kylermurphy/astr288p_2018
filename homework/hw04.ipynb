    "## 3. Drift Resonance in the Magnetosphere (30 marks)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Earth's magnetosphere is the region of near-Earth space dominated by the Earth's magnetic field. The magnetosphere is comprised of several different cold and hot plasma (protons, electrons, and ionized atoms) regimes. The Earth's outer radiation belt is one of these regime; a torodial region between ~2-7 Earth radii ($R_E$) populated by trapped electrons with energies from 100s of keV to multiple MeV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the outer radiation belt exists in a quiescent or quiet state. However, during geomagnetic storms driven by coronal mass ejections eminating from sunspot pairs on the solar disc, the outer radiation belt can become extremely dynamic. This can lead to a rapid enhancement in the number of energetic electrons within the outer radiation belt. These electrons are referred to as _killer electrons_ and are capable of disrupting satellite operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this question we are going to investigate the dynamics of these electrons in response to an increase in solar wind density which leads to development of a drift-resonance, a discrete wave, in the electron spectra. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file '../data/OMNI.dat' contains the solar wind number density $\\rho_{sw}$, velocity $v_{sw}$, and  the southward component of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) $B_{z,\\,sw}$ as a function of time on 31 October 2012. \n",
    "\n",
    "The file '../data/VanAllen.dat' contains the flux $J$ and residual flux $j_r$ of energetic electrons as function of time and electron energy as observed on 31 October 2012 from 15:00-16:30 UT. The residual flux is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ j_{r,i} = \\frac{J_i-J_{avg}}{J_{avg}} $$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Where $i$ is the time point, $J_i$ is the flux at a $i$, and $J_{avg}$ is a 10 minute average of $J$ centered on $J_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The headers in both files are denote by a _#_ as the first entry and identify what each of the columns are and the units for each column. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. (10 Marks) Read in and plot $\\rho_{sw}$, $v_{sw}$, $B_{z,\\,sw}$, $J$ and $j_r$ on a 5 panel plot between 15:00-17:00 UT on 31 October 2012. Be sure to propoerly label all y-axis' and format the x-axis with a an appropriate time format. Include a legend for the $J$ and $j_r$ plots as there is more then a single electron energy. Note the range of $J$; is a linear y-axis appropriate for this plot? What are the gaps in the line plots in the solar wind and IMF data? What are the resolutions of each of the time series (you can read this directly from the files)?\n",
    "1. (10 Marks) From the above it should be clear that a discrete wave is observed in the electron observations (both $J$ and $j_r$). Calculate the power spectra (using any of the methods from class) of the residual flux as a function of electron energy. Store the power spectra in a single array ```pspec[y,x]``` where the first dimension ```y``` corresponds to _electron energy_ and the second dimension ```x``` corresponds to _frequency_. What window did you use and why? What is the frequency and period of the oscillation? What electron energy does the power of the osciallation peak at? \n",
    "1. (10 Marks) Plot the power spectra of the residual fluxes as an image or _spectrogram_. The y-axis should have electron energy, x-axis should be frequency, and the power spectra should be shown in color. Include a color bar and label all axis. What are the units of power spectra?\n"
